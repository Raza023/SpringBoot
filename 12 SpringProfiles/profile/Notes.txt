###########################Spring profiles###########################

It is used for switching the environment and for restricting the access in each environment.

Suppose I am using swagger feature to generate the rest document,
I don't want to enable this swagger feature in all our environments.
In this case we will use @Profile for that.

I created an application, It moved to QA and QA people found some bugs.
But the bugs are only showing in QA environment.
But in dev environment it is working fine.
We will transfer all the urls and db related stuff to QA env. Does not sound good
In this case we will use @Profile

If you want to segregate the parts of Application you can use @Profile
to make it available only in certain environments.


###########################Working###########################
let's create three schemas for three env (environments):
1) loc (local)
2) dev (development)
3) prod (production)

based on my configurations it will fetch the data from corresponding schema.

If I have not mentioned any env. It will go to the local schema.
