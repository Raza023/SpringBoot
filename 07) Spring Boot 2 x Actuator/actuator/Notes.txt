Actuator:

We use it to monitor our application in each of the environment.
It's a key component of Spring boot.

Let's discuss key features:
1) By default only one health(http://localhost:8080/actuator/health) endpoint is available.
2) To enable all other end points we need to exclude them in property file.

3) Let's create our customized health indicator. to enable it add property
(management.endpoint.health.show-details=always)
