1) What is Micro services?
Micro services is architectural way to design our application uniquely with several small modules developed individually, packaged individually and deployed individually in individual processes.

Before Micro services we were using Monolithic architecture (approach).

2) Monolithic architecture:
We develop all services individually and then developing, packaging in a single war file and deploy to server.

3) Monolithic architecture drawbacks:
(i)  performance issue due to huge data (we are packaging in a single war file so data will be huge)
(ii) continuous deployment not possible (one module not working whole project will be disturbed, wait will be long)
(iii) Adapting new technologies will be difficult.(one different and other different like java or python)
(iv)  Overloaded IDE and overload web container. (same as 3(i))
(v)  Exception propagation is not proper. (one fails will effect the others)
(vi) Code readability is not present. (working with one module will require understanding all others)

Microservice architecture:
(opposite to Monolithic architecture in terms of features)
For Passenger management (own db and independently deployment)
For Driver management (own db and independently deployment)
For Trip management (own db and independently deployment)

Spring boot supports Microservices (and its features like hestrics)
