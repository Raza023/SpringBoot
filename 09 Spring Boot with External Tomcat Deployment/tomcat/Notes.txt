Tomcat, JBoss (now WildFly), and WebLogic are all Java application servers, but they have different strengths and cater to different needs.

1) Create a project with war packaging, it will add ServletInitializer class in your application and also adds spring-boot-starter-tomcat.
2) add one property in properties of main pom. 
<start-class>com.example.tomcat.TomcatApplication</start-class>
and make sure packaging is war. <packaging>war</packaging>
3) Create application
4) Run mvn clean install(build) it will build a .war
5) download tomcat, and install smart tomcat plugin
