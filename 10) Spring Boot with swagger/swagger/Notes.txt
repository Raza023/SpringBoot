Swagger:
What is Swagger?
It is used t create documentation for all the RestEndPoints available in our application. 
We create a lot of microservices , so it is difficult to remember all the endpoint URLs. 

Purpose:
1) Quick UI integration:
Let's say if I have to send @RequestBody, RequestURL and ReturnResponse to someone (UI developer).
If I provide him html api which is generated by swagger. He can map easily for his UI and can integrate quickly.
